This account, managed by teenagers Saifeena and Subhan, has approximately 6,48,000 followers and has posted over 217 posts, many of which promote illegal and abusive practices.The account glorifies and normalizes child marriage, a practice that is strictly prohibited under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006. Their videos and captions depict early marriage as desirable, misleading their large teenage audience into believing it is acceptable. This type of content not only violates the law but also encourages others to engage in similar practices, putting countless minors at risk of exploitation.Furthermore, several posts contain sexually suggestive and explicit undertones involving minors, which qualifies as child sexual abusive content under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. Sharing such content on a public platform objectifies children and increases their vulnerability to predators. It creates an unsafe environment for minors and indirectly promotes child sexual abuse by normalizing inappropriate behavior.This content harms society by endangering children, violating their rights, and promoting practices that lead to their exploitation. It encourages grooming and abuse while eroding the moral fabric of society. The platf",Crime Against Women & Children,Publishing and Transmitting Obscene Material

A WhatsApp group consisting of my friends has circulated viral news claiming that I am in a serious situation and that they need financial help on my behalf.

This has led to others being misled and bothered for money, which has caused significant damage to my reputation and mental peace.



2. Harassment and Abuse:

Members of this group have been using abusive and offensive language during phone calls with me.

They continue to irritate and provoke me, worsening my mental state.



3. Mental Stress and Academic Impact:

These incidents have deeply affected me mentally, leaving me feeling stressed and unable to focus on my exams and daily activities.

The continuous harassment has caused severe emotional distress, making it difficult to cope with the situation.




Request for Action:
I kindly request your inte",Other Cyber Crimes,Defamation

Crime Against Women and Children,Rape/ Gang Rape,"Subject: Anonymous Complaint Regarding Instagram User Promoting Violence and Criminal Behavior

To Whom It May Concern,

I am filing this anonymous complaint regarding an individual on Instagram whose behavior and content pose a potential threat to public safety. The account details are as follows:

Instagram Username: [@_harrryy___00]

Profile Link: [https://www.instagram.com/_harrryy___00?igsh=MTRhZ3ZrY3c5YjUydg==]


The user has repeatedly posted stories and highlights displaying firearms, including videos/photos that glorify gun culture. These posts are tagged with captions like ""Gangster,"" which not only promote violence but also create fear among viewers. Such public displays of firearms, even if licensed, appear to violate the Arms Act, 1959, and the IT Act, 2000, for the following reasons:

1. Encouraging and glorifying a dangerous lifestyle.


2. Potentially intimidating others by brandishing weapons on a public platform.



Evidence Provided:

Attached screenshots of the Instagram highlights featuring firearms and captions.

Detailed account of posts glorifying criminal behavior.


I request you to:

1. Investigate the legitimacy of the individual’s gun ownership.


2. Verify whether the posts violate Indian laws regarding the public display of firearms.


3. Take strict action to ensure public safety and prevent the spread of violence-promoting content.



I am reporting this matter anonymously for my safety and trust that my identity will remain protected.

Crime Against Women and Children,Rape/ Gang Rape,"On December 7, 2024, while checking my LinkedIn notifications as usual, I came across a disturbing comment made by Manish Sharma on one of my posts. The comment contained highly abusive language directed at both me and my family. I am uncertain about the intention behind this, though I know he was a former college mate. Upon seeing the comment, I immediately reported and deleted it from LinkedIn to prevent further issues and informed a close friend about the incident.  

My friend managed to find his contact number through our college WhatsApp group and reached out to him to address his behavior. However, during the call, Manish disconnected abruptly and blocked my friend’s number. Despite this, he has continued his harassment by sending abusive messages from an alternate number (09353291260). This ongoing behavior is deeply concerning and unacceptable.

A Detailed Account of My Current Situation

Over the past few months, I have found myself in an increasingly distressing and toxic situation involving my boyfriend, whose behavior has left me emotionally shattered and mentally drained. This account is my effort to describe, in detail, the challenges I am facing, the toll it has taken on my mental health, and the steps I have taken to protect myself. I am sharing this with the hope of receiving guidance and support to navigate this overwhelming phase in my life.

The Background

The relationship began on a positive note, as most relationships do. However, over time, I noticed certain patterns in his behavior that became concerning. He would often display controlling tendencies—monitoring my activities, questioning my decisions, and belittling my feelings whenever I tried to express myself. At first, I dismissed these signs, attributing them to misunderstandings or differences in personality. I tried my best to work through these issues, convinced that with enough communication and effort, things would improve.

Unfortunately, instead of improving, his behavior became more toxic over time. He began criticizing me more frequently, undermining my self-confidence, and crossing boundaries that I had clearly set. His actions were emotionally draining, and I found myself feeling more isolated and unhappy as the relationship",Crime Against Women & Children,Cyber Stalking

I was approached by the Instagram account wingsofunicorn_, claiming to be HR for Casting Modelling Agency. She stated they were recruiting freelance models for a campaign and provided a third-party email, digitalfashionandmodeling@gmail.com, for further communication.

Through Google Chat, they introduced a three-round listing process:
	1.	First Round: I submitted general photos of my face, nails, and tongue.
	2.	Second Round: I was asked for explicit photos in sexualized poses, presented as standard requirements.
	3.	Third Round: The alleged director corebohemian (now deleted) demanded explicit videos in the same poses.

I later discovered the Instagram group chat they added me to, along with participants’ profiles, were fake. These profiles used stolen photos from previous victims. Suspicious, I found and contacted the real girl behind one profile, who confirmed this is a scam she also experienced in 2020. She revealed they have been exploiting victims for over five years.

Crime Against Women and Children,Publishing and transmitting obscene material/ sexually explicit material,A few days ago a boy from my college messaged me on Instagram for the first time. Since then we have been in contact for about a week. Initially our conversations were flirty but they quickly turned serious with him persistently requesting sexual favors. He insisted on meeting at an OYO hotel while I preferred a casual first meeting. Trusting him I sent him some private photos. However without my knowledge or consent he took screenshots of two of them just before I unsent them. When I expressed fear and reluctance to fulfill his demands he felt rejected. In response he sent me a screenshot of one of the photos which I sent to him and again he pressured me to meet him. Despite my pleas to delete the photo he claimed it could only be removed if I met him and deleted myself. He also obtained my phone number under the pretense of showing me his gallery on WhatsApp. After he sent me a screenshot of the gallery (which did not include my photo) I blocked him on Instagram. This hurt his ego as he then again sent my photo on WhatsApp and said that I had forced him to blackmail me. He revealed that he had only shown me the top part of his gallery and my photo was hidden further down. At this point I felt deeply ashamed vulnerable and devastated. It is a deep matter of concern for me because I was semi nude in that photo and it could be misused very badly to defame me. I just want his smartphone to get rid of my photo.

Crime Against Women and Children,Defamation,Dear Sir/Mam I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding the harassment and defamation I have faced from Lending Plate despite having fully settled my loan.I took out a loan of 40 000 from your app  for which I was supposed to pay approximately 10 000 in monthly installments. Unfortunately  due to certain circumstances  I was unable to pay the EMIs on time. I understand that a case was filed against me due to this delay  which is acceptable. However  after the case was filed  your team continued to harass me. They visited my house  contacted my office colleagues via phone calls  and even emailed my office management  labeling me a defaulter. This caused significant distress and damage to my professional reputation.The harassment escalated when a collection manager named Mandeep emailed my office management about my loan. Upon receiving the email  I immediately contacted the number mentioned in the email to settle the matter. After negotiations  I agreed to settle the loan for 28 000. I made payments every month  starting with 8 000  followed by 8 000  5 000  and finally 7 000  which I paid on Friday  September 13  2024. After the final payment  I received a No Objection Certificate (NOC) confirming that no amount was pending  and I believed the matter was resolved. However  to my shock  today  on September 16  2024  at 1516  Lending Plate sent another email to my office management  falsely stating that I had not paid the loan. This email led to my managemen,Financial Crimes,Online Loan Fraud

Crime Against Women and Children,Defamation,I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding a serious case of defamation and harassment I have been experiencing over the past two days. The nature of this complaint involves malicious actions conducted by unknown individuals that are severely affecting my personal and professional life. Over the past two days  I have been targeted by individuals who have made repeated phone calls to my colleagues and relatives  asking them to connect with me and sending spam messages  including OTPs  to my entire organization and family. These individuals have used unknown numbers to contact my colleagues and relatives  attempting to defame me and harass them under the pretext of urgent matters. When I reached out to the numbers provided to me by these callers  I encountered threats from an individual who claimed that the harassment would continue. The threat was made from a number which I will provide separately if needed. One of the numbers that contacted me was associated with RBL Bank  where I was asked about outstanding credit card payments. Due to a current financial crisis  I am unable to meet the payment demands. Despite my willingness to settle the account in the future  the approach taken by the banks representatives has been inappropriate. The representatives have not only harassed me but also contacted my colleagues and relatives  causing reputational damage,Other Cyber Crimes,Defamation

Recently, a girl named Ananya added me to a WhatsApp group and convinced me to download the SMIFSMAX app using a link she shared. She showcased what appeared to be considerable profits from small investments, which persuaded me to invest ?70,000 in total, believing it was a legitimate opportunity.

The application initially indicated that my investment had grown to ?110,000 through IPO investments. However, when I attempted to withdraw my funds, they requested that I invest an additional ?100,000 before allowing any withdrawals. After some investigation, I discovered that this is likely a scam.

I am requesting your help in recovering my capital investment and preventing others from falling victim to similar scams. My initial transaction was for ?20,000, of which I have received a refund of only part of that amount into my HDFC account (Account Number: 00881610096093).

Financial Crimes,Tech Support Scam/Customer Case Scam,"I was searching for a life partner on Jeevansathi. A lady named Preety was introduced to me by her mother on Jeevansathi on 18th sep 2023. We chatted and introduced ourselves. A few weeks later, she introduced the concept of cryptocurrency to me for investment. She told me I could earn more with that investment. She introduced the platform Deuncoin where funds are transferred through USDT. Initially, she transferred some amount in USDT form on that platform and gave me instructions on trading cryptocurrency. Every trade was profitable. Then, I tried to withdraw the amounts. For that, I contacted customer care. They told me I had to deposit tax to withdraw that amount.I resisted and told them they could debit the tax directly from the Deuncoin wallet. They denied it, so I have to deposited that amount by taking a huge loan. After that, they informed me that my withdrawal was not possible because the associated account, which was opened using Preeti invitation code, had deposited money linked to money laundering, and I had to pay a fine, otherwise the account would be frozen. They always gave me a short time to deposit the amount, and in the hope of recovering my funds, I lost a huge amount. I was devastated. I gave them more money in the hope of getting my funds back, but they rejected my withdrawal requests every time.Now, I am in massive debt and feel constantly depressed. it is getting hectic for me to pay my debt.

Financial Crimes,Online Loan Fraud,"The Navi App allows customers to make bill payments for services like mobile recharges, loan repayments, etc., through the Bharat Bill Payment System and other methods. Users can select the bill to pay and choose from various payment options such as Navi UPI, other UPI apps, or debit cards. Third-Party Application Providers (TPAP) should not allow customers to edit the payment amount during the UPI intent flow, and the amount must be fixed as per the initial bill. However, Flipkart UPI, a TPAP, allowed customers to modify the payment amount in the UPI flow.Some customers exploited this loophole, selecting higher bill amounts and then editing the payment to INR 1/- at the payment stage. For example, a customer selected a mobile recharge of INR 3,999 but changed the payment to INR 1/- at the payment stage. After making the INR 1/- payment, the company was notified of a successful payment and processed the full amount (INR 3,999).This fraud caused significant financial losses to the company, with the total fraud amount reaching INR 14,37,34,679, involving 43,242 fraudulent transactions and 2,713 individuals.

Initially I joined a WhatsApp group via an invitation from Instagram. In this group I was assisted by a person who provided updates and instructions regarding investments. They introduced me to an application and registered me on it. However when the application ceased functioning I was directed to use a website instead.
I was advised to purchase an IPO and was offered a loan to facilitate this purchase. Subsequently I was encouraged to invest further in additional IPOs which I also financed through a loan. In total I invested approximately INR 80,00,000  in various IPOs.
When I attempted to withdraw my funds my request was denied. I was told that I needed to pay  for brokerage fees before I could process the withdrawal. After paying this amount I still faced issues with withdrawing my funds. Furthermore I have lost all contact with the individuals involved.",Financial Crimes,Investment Scam/Trading Scam

Financial Crimes,Online Loan Fraud,In November 2024 I discovered Shoonyasi an investment broker platform while browsing Instagram for stock market tips. Joined a WhatsApp group X900 Shoonya Wealth Freedom where stock market tips were shared. Received a personal message from Divyanshi who claimed to work with Shoonya by Finvasia. Group members shared positive experiences and profits from the tips. Started investing small amounts based on the tips and saw profits. Directed to log in to the Shoonyasi app now renamed TRASHOONYA and complete KYC. The app seemed legitimate with stock details and transactions. Asked to transfer money to various bank accounts provided by them. First transfer of Rs 5000 made on December 6 2024. When transactions got declined they shared alternate bank details. Transferred money to multiple bank accounts they shared. Tried to withdraw Rs 12000 on December 19 2024 and was able to do so successfully. Gained confidence and invested Rs 54 lakh between December 6 and December 30 2024. Suspicion arose when Divyanshi claimed I could receive IPO allotments even after an IPO closed. Tried to back out but they pressured me warning of consequences like freezing my funds and damaging my credit score. They even offered a loan but I refused. Later told I needed to pay 30 percent of my investment plus profits equal Rs 37 lakh to withdraw my funds. Refused to pay and they blocked me from the group deleted the group and took away access to the app,Financial Crimes,Investment Scam/Trading Scam

a new way of scamming gullible people by convincing them to invest in
Crypto exchange named ZIOPTO and causing people to lose large sums of
money.I lost around INR 53 Lakhs, and many others across different cities
in India have also been scammed. How It Happens: WhatsApp Group:
Victims join a group titled ""EG-Training Group-004"". The group includes
many other people, making it look legitimate. Two main scammers: Dean
Akshay Varma and Assistant Nitya Bhattacharya. Initial Trust Building: The
scammers provide stock market tips, leading to some initial profits. They
then introduce the victims to the Ziopto trading platform, a fake crypto
exchange. Crypto Trading: Victims receive a small bonus (e.g., 120 USD)
to start trading. After making small withdrawals, victims feel the platform is
trustworthy. Scammers encourage trading crypto twice a day and investing
more money, offering rewards for larger deposits. Advanced Scheme:
Victims are urged to invest in new coins with promises of high returns.
Initially, small profits are shown to build confidence. Victims are then
convinced to invest large sums. Daily calls with tips on unknown coins lead
to consistent losses. Loan and Further Deception: Victims are offered a
loan (e.g., 500000 USDT) to invest in an IPO coin. Scammers claim the
loan needs only principal repayment. Victims are told they won significant
amounts (e.g., 70000 coins worth INR 30 Crores)

(4301 NRI Greens, Sunrakh Road, Vrindavan-281121)I spoke to a person, Sumesh Kumar Suri/Krishna Das, on Facebook and Whatsapp. He runs ads on Facebook, claiming that he runs a matrimony service for ISKCON devotees. The name of the group on Facebook is Matrimony Vrindavan (Devotee Girls). Thats how I found his profile. I believe hes also in charge of the organization - Radha Krishna Divine Seva Trust. After interacting with him, I made a payment worth 21000 INR to an HDFC bank account on 11th March 2024. The account holders name is Sumesh Kumar Suri. I have attached a detailed screenshot for your review. There was no proper service after the payment was made. He comes up with random excuses, stating that the reason for the delay is due to Holi. Many families dont opt for matchmaking due to Holi, etc... When I try to call him, he doesnt answer my calls. He seems to be running automated messages on whatsapp staying that the process is on, and feedback has been received from families, but he doesnt provide actual details as to what he or his team has done. I have to follow up with him for feedback and details. I have not received any service for the payment made. Please help me to recover my money.

To prove my innocence, they insisted I transfer money to accounts they claimed were under investigation, assuring that the funds would be verified and returned if no illegal activity was found.The entire ordeal was psychologically taxing, as they employed fear and urgency to manipulate me. It later became clear that these individuals were scammers exploiting my trust and fear of legal repercussions. Their sophisticated tactics were aimed at extorting money while leaving me questioning my own security and identity protection.

In whatsapp also, I can see some malfunction. Like in some cases pics send by  A person is also visible in  B  persons chat like as if   B  have also forwarded me the same photos. Whereas the   B person in noway can forward that pic as its personal communication between me and person A.

Financial Crimes,SIM Swap Fraud,"Unauthorized Transactions and SIM Swap Fraud on Axis Bank Account

I am writing to report a serious issue regarding my Axis Bank savings account which has been compromised.

On the 2nd and 3rd of June at around 8:50 am, unauthorized transactions totaling ?85,600/- were made from my account. 
The issue began on the 1st of June when my mobile number stopped working unexpectedly. 
Despite my attempts to restore service, I was unsuccessful. Due to the election poll in Kolkata on the 1st of June and Sunday being a non-working day, my mobile number remained non-functional.

On the 2nd of June, I tried to check my account using the Axis Bank mobile app and discovered the unauthorized transactions. I attempted to call my mobile number from another phone, and it briefly connected before switching off again. 
I immediately contacted Airtel (my mobile operator) to investigate the issue. They informed me that a SIM change request was made on the 2nd of June 2024, which was done without my knowledge or authorization.

I urgently request a thorough investigation into how the SIM replacement was processed without my fingerprint or authorization and the subsequent unauthorized transactions from my bank account. The One-Time Password (OTP) service appears to have been diverted to an unknown person, leading to this fraudulent activity.

Please assist me in recovering the lost funds and securing my account to prevent further unauthorized access.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this mat",Financial Crimes,SIM Swap Fraud

Nature of the Call: A third-party individual claimed to be from Airtel and offered 5G services, during which they obtained an OTP from me. I realised next day morning when my phone was not working and not receiving any phone calls, I then doubted that the previous day call was  a fraudulent attempt to perform an eSIM swap. Within 24 hours, i.e on 26th June morning around 8:30am  I called Airtel 121 and explained the situation . They confirmed that Airtel not made any calls previous day, and also confirmed that there was a request was for issuing eSIM. Based on my complaint, they immediately suspended the mobile number. Also told that eSIM is not activated and hence no one has any control over the phone number. They asked us to go to Airtel store and get new SIM. Accordingly, went to Airtel Store Sector-50 Noida and taken new physical SIM on 26th June. They told that the new SIM would be activated within 24hrs time. . 
Activation of New SIM: The new SIM got activated on 27th June, around 8pm  and I was able to call/ receive calls. And on 28th morning, again my phone number was not working and was suspended. Then, I called Airtel store to know the reason for this. Upon inquiring, I was informed that a complaint regarding suspicious activities on the number had been sent to cybercrime on the night of 27th June. This complaint resulted in the suspension of my number again.  Not sure Airtel reported or someone else.",Financial Crimes,SIM Swap Fraud

It was illegally ported to Airtel without my consent on 29th November 2024.I suspect the fraudster targeted my number for its uniqueness, using SIM swapping or cloning to transfer ownership under the name Amol Niraj Kasliwal Jain (address B-20, Arihant Nagar, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, Pin-431001).

The culprits details are available and can lead to uncovering the full modus operandi.

When I refused to comply, he began sending me threatening messages from unknown numbers, pressuring me to pay. Fearing damage to my reputation and mental distress, I blocked him, but he continued to contact me through different numbers and social media accounts.

Financial Crimes,Sextortion/Nude Video Call,"100. I, Kavita Kaushal, 23, a resident of Hyderabad, am filing a complaint against an individual named Ravi Kumar, who falsely identified himself as an officer from the Crime Branch's Cyber Division. On August 15, 2024, I received a WhatsApp message from the number 7584123690, where he introduced himself as ""Inspector Ravi Kumar"" from the Hyderabad Cyber Crime Police. He claimed that my mobile number was flagged in connection with an ""obscene chat scandal"" and that explicit material had been shared from my device. Initially, I was confused and asked for clarification. He then sent a digitally altered legal notice via WhatsApp, displaying an FIR number, my full name, phone number, and an official-looking police stamp. The document stated that I was under ""digital arrest"" and that I had 24 hours to cooperate before an arrest warrant would be issued against me. He mentioned that my Aadhaar and PAN details had been linked to the case and that a formal police team would visit my residence if I did not comply immediately. When I expressed disbelief, he connected a video call through WhatsApp, showing a man dressed in a police uniform inside a setting that looked like a cybercrime office. He warned me that if I failed to provide immediate cooperation, my family would be notified, and my name would be added to an online registry of sex offenders. To make matters worse, he sent me a digitally morphed nude video featuring my face, claiming that it was retrieved from an ""ongoing investigation."" He alleged that this video was found in a criminal WhatsApp group and that I could be charged under multiple sections of the IPC and IT Act for distributing obscene material. In a panic, I begged him to help me resolve the issue. He then demanded ?2,50,000 to ""clear my name from the system"" and delete all records of my supposed involvement. When I hesitated, he increased the pressure by forwarding the fake nude video to my own WhatsApp number as a ""preview"" and threatened to send it to my contacts. Fearing social humiliation, I immediately transferred ?1,00,000 to a bank account he provided, which was registered under the name ""Rohit Enterprises."" After making the transfer, he continued to demand more money, saying that the ""file deletion process"" required an additional ?1,50,000. At this point, I grew suspicious and searched online for similar scams. Realising I was being duped, I refused further payment and contacted the real Hyderabad Cyber Crime Police, who confirmed that no such case existed against me. I am now filing this complaint to take strict legal action against Ravi Kumar for impersonating a police officer, fabricating legal documents, using deepfake technology for sextortion, and committing financial fraud. I request the authorities to trace his phone number and bank account, take immediate action to prevent further victims, and ensure justice is served.",Uncategorized,Uncategorized

He stated that my Aadhaar and mobile number were found linked to an international pornography racket and that my online activities were under investigation. He then sent a fake digital arrest warrant via Telegram, which contained my full details, a forged CBI seal, and a case reference number.

Now, I am locked out of something I spent years building, and I feel powerless to stop them from misusing it.This isnt just a game account for meits deeply tied to my online identity and my connections with others. I am terrified that this person might impersonate me, harm my reputation, or exploit my social connections in the game.

These messages were crafted to create a sense of urgency, leading the recipients to believe that we were in dire need of financial assistance.As soon as we were made aware of this fraudulent activity, we attempted to verify our WhatsApp account. However, upon launching the application, we were surprised to find that our account had been logged out. Attempts to regain access were unsuccessful, as the verification code required for reauthentication was being sent to an unknown mobile number, which we suspect belongs to the individual(s) responsible for this",Financial Crimes,Identity Theft

When I refused, they blocked me and threatened to abandon my belongings in Hyderabad. Krishan Singh has since harassed my elderly mother, demanding the additional amount. Despite reporting the issue to the Cyber Police Station in Trivandrum and the Peroorkada Police Station, no action has been taken. Singh remains defiant, confident that he cannot be held accountable. This ordeal has caused immense stress, particularly as I relocated to care for my ailing grandmother. I humbly request your intervention to ensure justice, prevent such scams, and protect others from similar distress.

Financial Crimes,Advance Fee,On 27 Feb 2024  I enrolled in a training program with ACTE Training Institute  for which I paid an advance fee as per their policies. The institute assured the provision of training on a specified date. However  to my dismay  the training was not provided as promised  and there has been a complete failure on their part to fulfill the commitment made during the enrollment process. Despite my repeated attempts to seek resolution and clarification on the delayed training  ACTE Training Institute has been unresponsive. There was so much uncertainties and after repeated requests I had a chat with Trainer and I didnâ€™t feel he was a suitable trainer. Furthermore  the institute has failed to return the advance payment I made  which is a clear violation of customer trust and amounts to fraud.While investigating further  I realized ACTE has swindled countless of people like me and I humbly request immediate intervention and action to investigate this matter. I seek a thorough inquiry into the fraudulent practices of ACTE Training Institute and the financial irregularities. The lack of adherence to the agreed upon training promise has caused considerable financial loss and mental distress because I could not fulfill my official work. I believe filing an FIR is necessary to bring these fraudulent activities to light and seek justice for the wrongful withholding of my funds and their fraudulent online practices. I am willing to cooperate fully with the investigation.,Uncategorized,Uncategorized

Trusting his assurance, I transferred the amount. However, his responses raised suspicion, so I asked a friend to inquire separately.

Despite repeated calls on Saturday, he delayed with excuses. Later, he claimed he was traveling to Ernakulam and would refund in cash on Sunday but failed to do so and kept avoiding the matter.

Cyber Attack/Dependent Crimes,Hacking-Defacement,"On July 30, 2024, Rainmaker experienced a significant defacement attack on its website. The incident, detected on July 27, 2024, after 11 00 AM, involved unauthorized alterations to the landing page, causing major disruption to normal operations and posing significant risks to organizational credibility and user trust. The attack did not result in a data breach as the website is static and not linked to any databases; data from lead forms stored on Google Drive remained unaffected. Suspicious activity was traced back to around 1:00 AM on the same day from several IP addresses. The website maintenance team discovered the unauthorized changes, leading to a swift restoration by 4:00 PM the same day. Technical assessment revealed the attack involved defacement with 80 malicious code files and one unauthorized cron job identified. Logs captured repeated unauthorized POST requests to potentially malicious PHP files, indicating attempts to manipulate server files. Although there was no impact on visitors systems, the attack temporarily disrupted website availability, risking user trust and reputation. Immediate containment measures included updating sensitive credentials, eliminating redundant FTP accounts and suspicious cron jobs, and thoroughly removing malicious files using Monarx Antivirus.",Cyber Attacks/Dependent Crimes,Hacking/Defacement

The content was clearly intended to harm both the companys image and the targeted employees reputations.Following this  on October 8th  the same individual sent a second email with similar defamatory content. Despite our company not responding to these emails  this person has since escalated their actions by posting harmful and misleading reviews on public platforms like Google and professional feedback sites like AmbitionBox. These reviews include inappropriate language and baseless accusations that violate the IT Act and appear to be a deliberate attempt to harm the company and target specific employees.We have documented evidence disproving the claims in these reviews and communications  which show a pattern of personal targeting rather than genuine feedback.

Unfortunately  due to certain circumstances  I was unable to pay the EMIs on time. I understand that a case was filed against me due to this delay  which is acceptable. However  after the case was filed  your team continued to harass me. They visited my house  contacted my office colleagues via phone calls  and even emailed my office management  labeling me a defaulter. This caused significant distress and damage to my professional reputation.The harassment escalated when a collection manager named Mandeep emailed my office management about my loan.

Other Cyber Crime,Defamation,I am writing to formally lodge a complaint regarding a serious case of defamation and harassment I have been experiencing over the past two days. The nature of this complaint involves malicious actions conducted by unknown individuals that are severely affecting my personal and professional life. Over the past two days  I have been targeted by individuals who have made repeated phone calls to my colleagues and relatives  asking them to connect with me and sending spam messages  including OTPs  to my entire organization and family. These individuals have used unknown numbers to contact my colleagues and relatives  attempting to defame me and harass them under the pretext of urgent matters. When I reached out to the numbers provided to me by these callers  I encountered threats from an individual who claimed that the harassment would continue. The threat was made from a number which I will provide separately if needed. One of the numbers that contacted me was associated with RBL Bank  where I was asked about outstanding credit card payments. Due to a current financial crisis  I am unable to meet the payment demands.

Other Cyber Crime,Cyber Terrorism,"Jagmeet Singh Leader of The New Democratic Party of Canada, Burnaby South, Canada,, who is known for his support of pro-Khalistan terrorists like Pannu and his organization SFJ, has been actively propagating violence against the Hindu community and Indian residents in Canada. However, no action has been taken against him by the Canadian authorities due to his political influence. Recently, Jagmeet Singh issued a letter accusing the Indian government of killing pro-Khalistan terrorist Hardeep Singh Nijjar in Canada. He further demanded action against the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), an organization known for protecting the rights of Hindus internationally. The intent behind this demand appears to be to create a more vulnerable situation for Indians and Hindus in Canada, giving terrorists like Gurpatwant Singh Pannu of Sikh for Justice a free hand to target them.Jagmeet Singh is well-connected with terrorist Gurpatwant Singh Pannu. Pannu, through a video and poster released by SFJ, offered a reward of 500,000 to track the whereabouts of the Indian High Commissioner in Canada, Sanjay Kumar Verma. In this video, a photo of Sanjay Kumar Verma was shown being hit by multiple bullets.The actions of Jagmeet Singh, Pannu, and SFJ constitute a criminal offense under the laws of Canada and are cognizable in nature.

Pannu has repeatedly issued threats in the past, targeting both the Indian government and its citizens, with his organization known for supporting terrorist acts.Just a few days ago, he released yet another video where he threatened the government with further acts of terrorism.

I believe that my rights as a consumer have been violated  and I seek your assistance in resolving this matter.On 16 June  2023  I initiated a withdrawal request for my winnings from the online gambling platform Teenpatti Reality. According to their terms and conditions  the withdrawal process is expected to be completed within a reasonable time frame of 24 hours. However  it has now been over a week since I made the request  and I am yet to receive the funds owed to me.I have made multiple attempts to contact the customer support team at Teenpatti Reality to inquire about the status of my withdrawal. However  their responses have been evasive  lacking in clarity  and failed to provide a resolution or a concrete timeline for the completion of my withdrawal. The lack of communication and transparency on their part is highly concerning and raises questions about the legitimacy and reliability of their services.The prolonged delay in processing my withdrawal not only causes me significant financial distress but also raises doubts about the platforms commitment to fulfilling its obligations to its customers.

Other Cyber Crime,Online Gambling-Betting Frauds,Respected Sir  Currently IPL fever is going on across country. While many apps like Dream 11  My Circle 11 so called having licensed for online gambling  there are few Groups emerged in between claiming they will help in creating a best team to compete nationally. One of my cousin has tried this in 2017  but he lost some 25k in giving the money to the scammer and then stopped. Recently one of my friend has done the same thing and got scammed. I genuinely want this type of scam to be investigated properly and take action accordingly. Hence knowingly I approached one such group in telegram and communicated with them in length. At first it sounds like they will really help but when they started asking money I was quite sure that these are same kind of groups. But to gather some payment transfer proofs I paid them 1999 for membership subscription. Then for some selected rank they asked for another 15k... but after lot of negotiation he asked for 8k which I paid in 2 gaps. Yes  my 10k is at stake. Now after the match got completed I was pretty sure that they cant do anything but also curious to understand their next step. At very late night they called me on whatsapp from the number 9596968195 and congratulate me like 3-4 times that I had won 25lakhs rupees as the bookie has settled my matter and asking for another 32k to get the prize money. Now I understand at what extent they can go for squizzing the money. My humble request to stop this crime so that no one got trapped.,Financial Crimes,Online Gambling/Betting Frauds

Cyber Attack/Dependent Crimes,Tampering with computer source documents,"Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to report a series of cybercrimes that have severely impacted my digital security and privacy. A few months ago, I noticed that I was unexpectedly logged out of my Instagram account. Though I managed to regain access temporarily, this was only the beginning of a more extensive cyberattack on my personal data and devices.

Upon returning home and turning on my PC, I discovered that my email account had been hacked. All my contacts were deleted, and my photos, as well as important documents stored in Google Drive, were erased. It became evident that my PC had been compromised.

A few days later, my Wi-Fi network was hacked, and I believe the hacker attempted to gain access to my phone as well. Recently, my Twitter account was also hacked. Despite multiple attempts to recover my accounts and secure my devices, I have been unsuccessful.

The hacker’s actions have not only tampered with my computer system but also erased essential documents and invaded my privacy. As of now, I am unable to use my computer safely, and I have disconnected my Wi-Fi to prevent further intrusions.

I request your immediate assistance in identifying and apprehending the criminal responsible for these attacks. I fear that without intervention, my digital security will remain at risk.

Cyber Attack/Dependent Crimes,Tampering with computer source documents,"Respected Sir,

I am writing to bring to your attention a serious issue I have been facing over the last 15 days. Someone has been attempting to activate an e-SIM using my mobile number, which has caused my physical SIM to stop working on four separate occasions. Despite changing my SIM card four times, the problem persists.

My name is Binod Kumar Chaudhary, and I am employed with the Indian Navy. I reside at Vertex Solitaire Building, Wayle Nagar, Kalyan West. I have also visited the Airtel Store at Khadakpada five times regarding this issue. The staff informed me that someone with an iPhone 13, IMEI number 351063313274238, has been trying to activate an e-SIM using my number. Each time an OTP request is made through the Airtel site, my SIM gets deactivated.

I have been using this mobile number since 2003, and it is linked to my bank accounts, office, and various important contacts and documents. Changing my number would cause significant inconvenience due to these connections.

I have approached the Airtel outlet in Kalyan and paid ?50 for each SIM replacement. The store staff advised me to file a police complaint for them to take further action.

I kindly request that you take immediate action regarding this matter. I am available for any further information or clarification that may be required. You can contact me at my mobile number 9323646902 or via email at bkdive.com@gmail.com.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Cyber Attack/Dependent Crimes,Tampering with computer source documents,"I am Puja Thakur, currently serving as the Librarian of the Main Library. Prior to this, I held the position of Assistant Librarian at the Faculty of Law. Recently, I encountered a distressing issue involving unauthorized access and transfer of my data by Mrs. Arti Chanta, who was recently assigned to the Law Department. As part of my transition to the Main Library, I was in the process of transferring my data from the computer system at the Law Department to the new system at the Main Library. This data includes my PhD thesis and other sensitive information.

During this transition, Mrs. Chanta accessed the computer system in the Law Library and accessed my email and used Anydesk to transfer my data to herself. I discovered this unauthorized activity when I logged into the Main Library system, previously used by Mrs. Chanta, and found my PhD files stored on it. This incident constitutes a severe violation of my privacy and intellectual property rights, and I am profoundly concerned about the potential misuse of my data.

The implications of this unauthorized access are grave, considering the sensitivity and significance of the data involved. My PhD thesis and research work are the results of years of dedicated effort and intellectual investment.

A person approached me under the guise of seeking a genuine relationship. Initially, their profile seemed legitimate, showcasing appealing qualities and values that matched my preferences. However, as conversations progressed, certain inconsistencies and red flags began to surface.  1. Fake Identity Their stories did not align, and attempts to verify their identity (e.g., through video calls or social media profiles) were avoided with excuses.  3. Pressure and Emotional Manipulation They tried to rush the relationship, using emotional tactics to gain trust.  I soon realized it was a scam and ceased communication.

Here is the link- https://khadiorganic.com/products/free-parshad And here is the link to social media video from where I found this ram mandir prasad link   https://www.instagram.com/reel/C19gwOxrY3o/?igsh=MXh5cWdsdjJrZ3Y3cQ== In this video the influencer is claiming he has received the prasad that is why it looked believable and I ordered prasad in first place. But later, after reading reports and after that website page is unavailable I am sure this is a fraud to collect personal data like phone number, name, address, card number and there is a high possibly of them making further money by selling our personal data without our permission. Plus they might try to access our bank account, upi, card or other modes of transactions to steal more money or scam further. Please look into the matter and warn other devotees who might fall for this. I would like to raise complaint against this website representatives and social media influencers spreading this fake news.",Financial Crimes,Online Shopping/E-commerce Frauds
Other Cyber Crime,Fake News,"I am writing on behalf of Reliance Industries Limited regarding a serious matter involving the spread of fake news about Mr. Anant Ambani, Executive Director of Reliance Industries, on X (formerly Twitter). Fraudulent accounts, suspected to be bots, are circulating false news claiming that Mr. Ambani has endorsed a cryptocurrency trading platform named Immediate FastX. These fabricated articles appear to redirect users to counterfeit websites masquerading as credible news sources like BBC, promoting crypto investments. The articles misleadingly imply Mr. Ambanis involvement with the platform, using his image alongside his wife, Ms. Radhika Merchant. These false narratives aim to deceive the public and defraud individuals into investing in the unverified platform. We request your office to investigate the source of these fake news articles, block the fraudulent websites, and work with online platforms to prevent further distribution of such content. Relevant evidence, including URLs of fake accounts and websites, is attached for your reference.

Subject, Application for refund of the amount bought by the breast person lying to me reg

I received a message from my professor on WhatsApp saying that he urgently needs some money.  They said they will give you the amount by 07.00 pm. His friend is in an ICU emergency.  so he asked me if I can send 9000 rupees to my friend and donot worry I will return you at 07.00pm.  Thinking that my professor asked, I took a loan from my friends and sent the amount.  First they gave me a gpay Number and the amount did not go to that gpay number.  Then they gave me the other gpay Number.  Only after that I sent them the amount to this gpay Number. Then they said they need some more amount and add that and I will send everything to you by 7.00pm and I believed it and sent it. He is asking again some more money if he still has 11000 give me and I will send it too.  I said I donot have money and I told another teacher of mine that you should ask and see if you can get it. It was only when they asked another teacher of mine. My teacher said this account is a fake Account. After that I went to my professors house and asked him.  Like this, they asked me for money in your name.  Only after that I came to know that all these processes are fake news and Fake Number. Then I asked who are you and they blocked the number.  I have bought and given that amount from my friends so I humbly request you to recovery the Amount.

I was approached by the Instagram account wingsofunicorn_, claiming to be HR for Casting Modelling Agency. She stated they were recruiting freelance models for a campaign and provided a third-party email, digitalfashionandmodeling@gmail.com, for further communication.

Through Google Chat, they introduced a three-round listing process:
	1.	First Round: I submitted general photos of my face, nails, and tongue.
	2.	Second Round: I was asked for explicit photos in sexualized poses, presented as standard requirements.
	3.	Third Round: The alleged director corebohemian (now deleted) demanded explicit videos in the same poses.

I later discovered the Instagram group chat they added me to, along with participants’ profiles, were fake. These profiles used stolen photos from previous victims. Suspicious, I found and contacted the real girl behind one profile, who confirmed this is a scam she also experienced in 2020. She revealed they have been exploiting victims for over five years.

The photos and videos do not contain any nudity but are sexual and intimate in nature. Akash sent her all the videos she had sent on “view once”, which he screen recorded. He used a different application to screen record all the videos that she sent him on view once as Insta does not allow “view once” videos or photos to be screen recorded.

Crime Against Women and Children,Publishing and transmitting obscene material/ sexually explicit material,A few days ago a boy from my college messaged me on Instagram for the first time. Since then we have been in contact for about a week. Initially our conversations were flirty but they quickly turned serious with him persistently requesting sexual favors. He insisted on meeting at an OYO hotel while I preferred a casual first meeting. Trusting him I sent him some private photos. However without my knowledge or consent he took screenshots of two of them just before I unsent them. When I expressed fear and reluctance to fulfill his demands he felt rejected. In response he sent me a screenshot of one of the photos which I sent to him and again he pressured me to meet him. Despite my pleas to delete the photo he claimed it could only be removed if I met him and deleted myself. He also obtained my phone number under the pretense of showing me his gallery on WhatsApp. After he sent me a screenshot of the gallery (which did not include my photo) I blocked him on Instagram. This hurt his ego as he then again sent my photo on WhatsApp and said that I had forced him to blackmail me. He revealed that he had only shown me the top part of his gallery and my photo was hidden further down. At this point I felt deeply ashamed vulnerable and devastated. It is a deep matter of concern for me because I was semi nude in that photo and it could be misused very badly to defame me. I just want his smartphone to get rid of my photo. I dont want revenge I want that he stops predating me & other girls,Crime Against Women & Children,Sextortion/Nude Video Call
